<p>Hello, my name is Zixi Cai. Welcome to my personal website.</p>
<p>I currently studying a Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of Adelaide, achieving a GPA of 6.25 in the first 3 semesters, and this is my fourth semester. I am highly skilled in coding, trading in capital markets, and Chinese. During my degree studies, I have particularly enjoyed the practicals in the labs and the coding assignments, when I get the expected output from my code, I feel a sense of accomplishment. I also particularly enjoyed trading and profiting in capital markets.</p>
<p>In the future I would like to work in the computer industry or the financial industry. I hope to write high-quality code or provide trading decisions. This aligns with my strengths in logical thinking, problem solving and decision making.</p>
<p>Outside of study, I enjoy travelling and have been to more than 10 countries, such as the United States, Italy, Singapore and Japan.</p>
